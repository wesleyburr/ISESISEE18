## The Problem {.fullslide}
<center>
<!-- % ![Chicago, Illinois, 1995](./assets/img/chicago_pm10_spike.png)-->

## Mechanism

- Ambient exposure triggers physiological symptoms
 - Morbidity (hospitalizations, health conditions) and Mortality (premature death due to physiological causes)
- Not just extreme events: there appears to be no "safe" lower limit
- Air pollution $\longrightarrow$ public health

## Concluding Remarks

- Simulation study underway to further understand implications of structural modeling
- Philosophical questions re: net association
- Should only *structural* relationships be mapped?
- Which lag is most appropriate as starting point? (background *noise*)
- Is there an optimal alignment procedure? (current work)
